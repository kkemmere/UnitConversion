# Unit Conversion
Simple Unit Converter made with JavaScript, HTML<br/>
This was created for my Web Programming class and fun!<br/>
Maybe one day it could be an iOS or Android application...
<br/>
<br/>
Very small and simple project that can be brought to much more interesting heights.<br/>
Code is unprotected and application can be run simply by downloading "calcforms.html" + "calcfunctions.js"<br/>
Application continuously calculates each time an input is seen, no submit button needed.
